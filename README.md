# Service Catalog Terraform Reference Architecture

## Solution Update

> **Note**
>
> AWS Service Catalog recently introduced support for [Terraform open source](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/04/aws-service-catalog-terraform-open-source/) so we recommend  users to use that instead. This sample will be deprecated in the future. More details on Service Catalog and Terraform open source can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicecatalog/latest/adminguide/getstarted-Terraform.html).

Please see [README_OLD](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-service-catalog-terraform-reference-architecture/blob/master/README_OLD.md) for the legacy README details.
